# Analysis 3 cheatsheet
A cheatsheet for the Analysis 3 course ([401-0353-00L](https://metaphor.ethz.ch/x/2025/hs/401-0353-00L/)), taken in fall 2025. The content is based primarily on the official [lecture notes](https://metaphor.ethz.ch/x/2025/hs/401-0353-00L/sc/texnotes.pdf) for the course.

Some mistakes are guaranteed; if you find any, please open an issue/pull request.

## Content
- Method of characteristics for first-order PDEs
- Conservation laws, shock waves, and Burgers' equation
- Classification of second-order PDEs (hyperbolic, parabolic, elliptic)
- Heat and wave equations with Dirichlet, Neumann, and mixed boundary conditions
- Separation of variables and eigenfunction expansions
- Elliptic problems in rectangular and circular domains
- Harmonic functions and maximum principles
- Appendix with trigonometric identities, Fourier series orthogonality, and derivative/antiderivative formulas

## Installation / Compilation
Requires a LaTeX distribution (TeX Live, MikTeX, etc.):

```bash
# compile main.tex using pdflatex or lualatex
pdflatex main.tex
```

- Multiple runs may be necessary for references, table of contents, and cross-references.
